    c. Subject to sub-clause (3) of this article a director or connected person may provide the charity with goods that are not supplied in connection with services provided to the charity by the director or connected person.

    b. The amount or maximum amount of the payment for the goods does not exceed what is reasonable in the circumstances for the supply of the goods in question.  
    c. The other directors are satisfied that it is in the best interests of the charity to contract with the supplier rather than with someone who is not a director or connected person.

    e. The supplier does not vote on any such matter and is not to be counted when calculating whether a quorum of directors is present at the meeting.  
    f. The reason for their decision is recorded by the directors in the minute book.  
    g. A majority of the directors then in office are not in receipt of remuneration or payments authorised by article 7.

### Conflicts of interests and conflicts of loyalties

    b. the conflicted director does not vote on any such matter and is not to be counted when considering whether a quorum of directors is present at the meeting; and  
    c. the unconflicted directors consider it is in the interests of the charity to authorise the conflict of interests in the circumstances applying.
