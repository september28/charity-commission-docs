## Intro
Charity Commission Documents in Markdown! I am "Open Sourcing" this work in the spirit of charity. 
These documents are the result of my attempts to transpose Charity Commission template documents for 
my charity [Foodshare](http://www.foodshare.org.uk).

Please note that these documents relate to the 
[Charity Commission](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/charity-commission) 
in the United Kingdom. As such, their content may not be applicable to other countries.
